## Offensive Security OSMR Exam Documentation

The Offensive Security OSMR exam documentation contains all efforts that
were conducted in order to pass the Offensive Security macOS Researcher
exam. This report will be graded from a standpoint of correctness and
fullness to all aspects of the exam. The purpose of this report is to
ensure that the student has the technical knowledge required to pass the
qualifications for the Offensive Security macOS Researcher certification.

### Objective

The objective of this exam is to solve four given assignments as
described in the control panel. The student is tasked with following a
methodical approach in analyzing and solving the assignments. The exam
report is meant to be a writeup of the steps taken to solve the
assignment, including any analysis performed and code written.

An example page has already been created for you at the latter portions of this
document that should give you sample information on what is expected to pass
this exam. Use the sample report as a guideline to get you through the
reporting, while removing any headlines that are not relevant to a specific
assignment.

### Requirements

The student will be required to fill out this exam documentation
fully and to include the following sections:

- High-Level summary of assignment solutions.
- Methodology walkthrough and detailed outline of steps taken through analysis and all written code.
- Each finding with included screenshots, walkthrough, sample code or reference.
- Screenshots of proofs.

## High-Level Summary

A brief description of the assignments that were solved, including the overall exploitation steps.


*Assignment 1:*
Exploitation steps summary for the assignment.

## Assignment 1

### Local.txt / Proof.txt / Secret.txt

**proof.txt**: `proof-txt-content`

**secret.txt**: `secret-txt-content`

### Initial Analysis

Provide relevant techniques and methods used to perform enumeration and
discovery of the application and/or the environment. The steps taken
should be reproducible and easy to understand. Include any custom code
or references to public tools.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

...
```

### Vulnerability Discovery

Provide relevant analysis steps to locate vulnerability inside the
application or environment, this includes results from static analysis
and/or dynamic analysis. Explain the vulnerability identified.

Only the steps that ended up working are required.

### Exploit / Bypass Creation

Provide a description of steps to create the exploit or security
control bypass. At the end of this section the full exploit (or bypass)
code should be developed while an explanation of each step should be
performed.

### Screenshots

The exam control panel contains a section available to submit your proof
files. The contents of the local.txt, proof.txt or secret.txt files
obtained from your exam machines must be submitted in the control panel
before your exam has ended. Note that the control panel will not indicate
whether the submitted proof is correct or not. 

Each local.txt, proof.txt or secret.txt found must be shown in a screenshot
that includes the contents of the file, as well as the IP address of the target
by using ipconfig.
