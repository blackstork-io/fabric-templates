## Offensive-Security OSWE Exam Documentation

The Offensive Security OSWE exam documentation contains all efforts
that were conducted in order to pass the Offensive Security Web Expert
exam. This report will be graded from a standpoint of correctness and
fullness to all aspects of the exam. The purpose of this report is to
ensure that the student has the technical knowledge required to pass
the qualifications for the Offensive Security Web Expert certification.

The student will be required to fill out this exam documentation fully
and to include the following sections:

- Methodology walkthrough and detailed outline of steps taken
- Each finding with included screenshots, walkthrough, sample code, and
  proof.txt if applicable.
- Any additional items that were not included

## High-Level Summary

I was tasked with performing a white-box penetration test towards
Offensive Security Exam. A white-box penetration test is sifting
through the massive amount of data available to identify potential
points of weakness. The focus of this test is to provide a
comprehensive assessment of both internal and external vulnerabilities.
My overall objective was to evaluate the application, identify
vulnerabilities, and write automated exploit while reporting the
findings back to Offensive Security.

When performing the white-box penetration test, there were several
critical vulnerabilities that were identified on Offensive Security's
network. When performing the attacks, I was able to gain access to
multiple machines, primarily due to design flaws and implementation
errors. During the testing, I had a shell access to multiple systems.
All systems were successfully exploited and access granted. These
systems as well as a brief description on how access was obtained are
listed below:


`192.168.XX.XX` - App Name - A short summary of the exploit path.


The penetration testing portions of the assessment focus heavily on
gaining access to a variety of systems. During this penetration test, I
was able to successfully gain access to 
1 out of the 50
systems.

### Recommendations

I recommend patching the vulnerabilities identified during the testing
to ensure that an attacker cannot exploit these systems in the future.
One thing to remember is that these systems require frequent patching
and once patched, should remain on a regular patch program to protect
additional vulnerabilities that are discovered at a later date.

## 192.168.XX.XX - App Name

### Local.txt / Proof.txt

**local.txt**: `local-txt-content`

**proof.txt**: `proof-txt-content`

### Vulnerability 1

Provide the method and code used to find the vulnerability 1.

### Vulnerability 2

Provide the method and code used to find the vulnerability 2.

### PoC Code

Provide the final proof of concept code used to gain access to the server.

```bash
echo "Hello"
```

### Screenshots

Provide screenshots of local.txt and proof.txt contents as stated in
the Exam Control Panel Objectives.

### Steps

Provide a detailed account of your methodology in creating the
exploits. The steps taken should be able to be easily followed and
reproducible if necessary.
