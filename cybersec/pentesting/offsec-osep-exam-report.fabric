      The Offensive Security OSEP exam documentation contains all efforts that
      were conducted in order to pass the Offensive Security Experienced
      Penetration Tester exam. This report will be graded from a standpoint of
      correctness and fullness to all aspects of the exam. The purpose of this
      report is to ensure that the student has the technical knowledge required
      to pass the qualifications for the Offensive Security Experienced
      Penetration Tester certification.

          test against the Offensive Security Exam network. The student is tasked
          with following methodical approach in obtaining access to the objective
          goals. This test should simulate an actual penetration test and how you
          would start from beginning to end, including enumeration and
          post-exploitation. The exam report is not meant to be a penetration
          test report, but rather a writeup of the steps taken to locate,
          enumerate and compromise the network.

          Enumeration and post-exploitation actions that lead to subsequent attacks with
          successful compromises should be included in the report.

          An example page has already been created for you at the latter portions of this
          document that should give you ample information on what is expected to pass
          this exam. Use the sample report as a guideline to get you through the
