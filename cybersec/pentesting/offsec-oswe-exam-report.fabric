        and to include the following sections:

        - Methodology walkthrough and detailed outline of steps taken
        - Each finding with included screenshots, walkthrough, sample code, and

        I was tasked with performing a white-box penetration test towards
        Offensive Security Exam. A white-box penetration test is sifting
        through the massive amount of data available to identify potential
        points of weakness. The focus of this test is to provide a
        comprehensive assessment of both internal and external vulnerabilities.
        My overall objective was to evaluate the application, identify
        vulnerabilities, and write automated exploit while reporting the
        findings back to Offensive Security.

        When performing the white-box penetration test, there were several
        critical vulnerabilities that were identified on Offensive Security's
        network. When performing the attacks, I was able to gain access to
        multiple machines, primarily due to design flaws and implementation
        errors. During the testing, I had a shell access to multiple systems.
        All systems were successfully exploited and access granted. These
        systems as well as a brief description on how access was obtained are
        listed below:

        {{ range .vars.hosts }}
        `{{ .host }}` - {{ .app_name }} - {{ .exploit_path }}
        {{ end }}

        The penetration testing portions of the assessment focus heavily on
        gaining access to a variety of systems. During this penetration test, I
        was able to successfully gain access to 
        {{ len .vars.hosts }} out of the {{ .vars.exam_env.hosts_overall_count }}
        systems.

          I recommend patching the vulnerabilities identified during the testing
          to ensure that an attacker cannot exploit these systems in the future.
          One thing to remember is that these systems require frequent patching
          and once patched, should remain on a regular patch program to protect
          additional vulnerabilities that are discovered at a later date.
