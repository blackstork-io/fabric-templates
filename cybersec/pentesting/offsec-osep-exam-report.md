## Offensive Security OSEP Exam Documentation

The Offensive Security OSEP exam documentation contains all efforts that
were conducted in order to pass the Offensive Security Experienced
Penetration Tester exam. This report will be graded from a standpoint of
correctness and fullness to all aspects of the exam. The purpose of this
report is to ensure that the student has the technical knowledge required
to pass the qualifications for the Offensive Security Experienced
Penetration Tester certification.

### Objective

The objective of this assessment is to perform an external penetration
test against the Offensive Security Exam network. The student is tasked
with following methodical approach in obtaining access to the objective
goals. This test should simulate an actual penetration test and how you
would start from beginning to end, including enumeration and
post-exploitation. The exam report is not meant to be a penetration
test report, but rather a writeup of the steps taken to locate,
enumerate and compromise the network.

Enumeration and post-exploitation actions that lead to subsequent attacks with
successful compromises should be included in the report.

An example page has already been created for you at the latter portions of this
document that should give you ample information on what is expected to pass
this exam. Use the sample report as a guideline to get you through the
reporting.

### Requirements

The student will be required to fill out this exam documentation fully and to include the following sections:

- High level summery of findings, including the depth of compromise.
- Methodology walkthrough and detailed outline of steps taken including enumeration.
- Each finding with included screenshots, walkthrough, sample code or reference.
- Screenshot of any local.txt, proof.txt or secret.txt.

## High-Level Summary

A brief description of the attack chain with machine names, including the depth of compromise should be included here.

### Network DOMAIN_NETWORK_A

|IP Address|Hostname|Compromised|Low-Privilege User|High-Privilege User|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|192.168.X.1|hostname-aaa|No|N/A|N/A|
|192.168.X.2|hostname-bbb|Yes|john|root|
|192.168.X.3|hostname-ccc|Yes|N/A|root|


The chain of attack followed for getting into the machines listed above,
in the network DOMAIN_NETWORK_A, was as follows:

1. foo
2. bar
3. baz

### Network DOMAIN_NETWORK_B

|IP Address|Hostname|Compromised|Low-Privilege User|High-Privilege User|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|192.168.X.10|hostname-ddd|Yes|john|bill|


The chain of attack followed for getting into the machines listed above,
in the network DOMAIN_NETWORK_B, was as follows:

1. xxx
2. yyy
3. zzz

## Network DOMAIN_NETWORK_A

### 192.168.X.1 / hostname-aaa

#### Local.txt / Proof.txt / Secret.txt

No proofs were obtained.

#### Pre-Compromise Enumeration Steps

Provide relevant techniques and methods used to perform
enumeration prior to initial compromise, the steps taken should
be able to be easily followed and reproducible if necessary.
Include any custom code or references to public tools.

#### Compromise

Provide a description of exploitation steps to compromise the
machine and obtain shell access, the steps taken should be able
to be easily followed and reproducible if necessary. Only the
steps that ended up working are required. Include any custom code
or references to public tools.

```bash
custom-code
```

#### Post-Exploitation Enumeration Steps

Provide relevant post-exploitation enumeration steps related to the
network or local privilege escalation, the steps taken should be
able to be easily followed and reproducible if necessary. Include
any custom code or references to public tools.

```python
x = 1
```

#### Local Privilege Escalation

Provide a description of exploitation steps to escalate
privileges on the machine if applicable, the steps taken should
be able to be easily followed and reproducible if necessary.
Include any custom code or references to public tools.

#### Screenshots

The exam control panel contains a section available to submit your
proof files. The contents of the local.txt, proof.txt and secret.txt
files obtained from your exam machines must be submitted in the
control panel before your exam has ended. Note that the control panel
will not indicate whether the submitted proof is correct or not. 

Each local.txt, proof.txt and secret.txt found must be shown in a screenshot
that includes the contents of the file, as well as the IP address of the target
by using ipconfig, ifconfig or ip addr.

#### Local.txt / Proof.txt / Secret.txt

**local.txt content**: local-txt-content

**proof.txt content**: proof-txt-content

**secret.txt content**: secret-txt-content

#### Pre-Compromise Enumeration Steps

Provide relevant techniques and methods used to perform
enumeration prior to initial compromise, the steps taken should
be able to be easily followed and reproducible if necessary.
Include any custom code or references to public tools.
